        - Having users put out their own alerts for other drivers to look out for 

    An app that i would like to build will be a blend of the MTA train status app and a daily to do list. This will circulate and focus on the idea of letting the user know the status of the trains they take in the morning once they look at their phones. A very annoying and prominent thing to deal with in New York City are the trains and their delays that happen at the worst time, especially when we don't allocate enought time and end up late to our destinations. This app would help with this problem, it would be displaying in 2 ways, one as the app and second as the lock screen section that appears once the phone alarm ends. The app would show the updates and news of the trains that the user picks themselves, the app would tell on that specific day any delays, destination commute time and if needed alternate routes that the user can take. The user would have to pick out the trains themselves, they can place the destination they take from the home address and it will calcualte the commute time and route they can take. This will be similar to any map app that shows directions. This would be more of a morning app that allows the user to know the news about their trains so that they can allocate time in the morning and have a more peaceful start to the day. There would also be a to do list that will appear to give a glimpse to the day. This would hopefully set the user to a good mentality that they know how their day can go.
